    <p style="font-size: 3em; background-color: grey; margin: 0;">The Coalition is how we gain the power to pass a Second Bill of Rights, a People's Bill of Rights. </p></br>
    <p style="font-size: 3em; background-color: grey; margin: 0;">For far too long a small group of people have held all the wealth and all the power at the expense of the majority of us. A Princeton Study in 2015 confirmed what we all know, that our representatives do not represent us, they only represent the interests of big money.</p></br>
    <p style="font-size: 3em; background-color: grey; margin: 0;">To change this and gain representation, we must organize like never before. Coalition members have committed to mobilizing for a mass day of action, Democracy Day. By joning together and flexing our collective muscle, we can build the power to pass a Second Bill of Rights that addresses the inequities of our past and present and paves the way to a future of equality, justice, and sustainability.</p></br>
    <p style="font-size: 3em; background-color: grey; margin: 0;">In the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we can end poverty, homelessness, and hunger and provide quality heathcare and education to everyone. We can lead the world in addressing climate change, end mass incarceration, stop the drug war, and provide a path to citizenship to those who have made this place thier home.</p></br>
    <p style="font-size: 3em; background-color: grey; margin: 0;">It's time we all come together and organize big to win big! </p>
