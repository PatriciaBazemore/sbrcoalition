<h1>We recognize that this country was built on the genocide of native peoples, the enslavement of Africans, the exploitation of immigrants, and the uncompensated work of women. People who hold vast amounts of wealth and power have acquired it at the sacrifice of others. While we can’t undo the past, we can come to terms with it and in doing so, heal ourselves and save our future. The majority of people want to live in a country where all of over basic needs are met and our rights are protected. It’s time we organize together in a way to gain the power we need to make that happen.</h1>
